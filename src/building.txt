
to build this project for yourself, I suggest using NetBeans
	check out the code using the 'Versioning' menu
	create a project based on the checked-out code
	add the following libraries:
		kallasoft smugmug java api
			http://www.kallasoft.com/smugmug-java-api/download/
		be sure to import all the jars from the 'lib' folder of the kallasoft library
		apache commons-lang
			http://commons.apache.org/lang/
		sanselan EXIF library (0.97)
			http://incubator.apache.org/sanselan/site/index.html

to run with the icons appearing correctly in the tree, ensure that the 'lib' directory is on the classpath
