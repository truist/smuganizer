
import combo order:
	album:album -> smugmug
	album:album:album -> smugmug

when creating a new category under smugmug, check to see if it already exists (in the tree, or just as one of the standard categories)

sort imported albums appropriately

hitting enter or double-clicking should open errors/interruptions

"show in tree" menu for transfer items

progress indicator for active task

implement a "new album" menu for SmugMug

create settings for gallery sort order (default/date vs. name)

create help instructions about converting "hidden" albums to actually being "protected" (permissions)

implement a "new category" and "new subcategory" menu for SmugMug

implement category drag-and-drop within the smugmug tree

implement password hint support for password protect dialog

need an application icon

keyword support

-----

add an "import from filesystem" option
	implement "move" transfer type for uploading

category move isn't implemented, both in SmugCategory and in SmugMug
	categories (and subcategories) can be moved around, but there is no easy way to
	update the api???? objects when doing so - I'll have to update the whole tree

"copy" isn't implemented

allow copying from one smugmug gallery to another

need a 'refresh' function for when changes are made via the website or other tools

not very useful import combinations:
	upload dialog (giving user all options)
		all the "upload dialog" combos
	image -> image
	album -> album
	error messages explaining invalid combos

really hard import combinations:
	album:mixed -> category
	album:mixed -> smugmug
	album:mixed:mixed -> smugmug
