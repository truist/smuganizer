
category move isn't implemented, both in SmugCategory and in SmugMug
	categories (and subcategories) can be moved around, but there is no easy way to
		update the api???? objects when doing so - I'll have to update the whole tree

"copy" isn't implemented

need a 'refresh' function for when changes are made via the website or other tools

need an application icon

-----

need to indicate metadata (hidden/protected) in tree

don't have any way to check for hidden albums - NEED TO WARN USERS

have to have a way to re-open the image window, if the user closes it

need to make the startup windows prettier

need to figure out sorting in the Gallery tree
	and the Settings menu

need to figure out import order - sorted (by what?) or not?

-----

get it into google
