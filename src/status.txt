
create setting for whether to use caption as filename
allow users to specify renamed filename
create setting for whether to overwrite/duplicate/rename automatically
support moving/importing a duplicate album in smugmug

implement "move" transfer type for uploading

ease of use improvements:
	sort imported albums appropriately
	create settings for gallery sort order (default/date vs. name)

tree refactoring improvements:
	implement a "new album" menu for SmugMug
	implement a "new category" and "new subcategory" menu for SmugMug
	implement category drag-and-drop within the smugmug tree
		categories (and subcategories) can be moved around, but there is no easy way to
		update the api???? objects when doing so - I'll have to update the whole tree
	implement a "promote to category" menu for subcategories

need an application icon

fix the logging

keyword support

package for release

-----

allow importing / moving in gallery, not just in smugmug
	and on the filesystem, once that is implemented

need a 'refresh' function for when changes are made via the website or other tools

not very useful import combinations:
	upload dialog (giving user all options)
		all the "upload dialog" combos
	image -> image
	album -> album
	error messages explaining invalid combos

really hard import combinations:
	album:mixed -> category
	album:mixed -> smugmug
	album:mixed:mixed -> smugmug

drag and drop out to/from the windows filesystem

copy/cut and paste support
