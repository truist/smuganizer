
import combo order:
	upload dialog
	error messages
	album:album -> category
	album:album -> smugmug
	album:mixed -> category
	album:mixed -> smugmug
	album:album:album -> smugmug
	album:mixed:mixed -> smugmug
	image -> image

progress indicator for active task

implement a "new album" menu for SmugMug

create settings for gallery sort order (default/date vs. name)

create help instructions about converting "hidden" albums to actually being "protected" (permissions)

implement a "new category" and "new subcategory" menu for SmugMug

implement category drag-and-drop within the smugmug tree

-----

add an "import from filesystem" option
	implement "move" transfer type for uploading

category move isn't implemented, both in SmugCategory and in SmugMug
	categories (and subcategories) can be moved around, but there is no easy way to
	update the api???? objects when doing so - I'll have to update the whole tree

"copy" isn't implemented

allow copying from one smugmug gallery to another

need a 'refresh' function for when changes are made via the website or other tools
