	<h1>Smuganizer</h1>
	<p>Welcome to Smuganizer!  This program serves two purposes:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>To allow you to view and modify your existing SmugMug gallery.</li>
		<li>To allow you to import images from Menalto Gallery in a safe, rational way.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Hopefully you will find that this program is easy to use - try right-clicking
	on any of the tree items, or using the menus above.  You can also drag images
	and albums around the tree.  Smuganizer will make all your changes instantly, on
	your site.</p>
	<p>You can also import images from an existing Gallery site (assuming you have login
	access).  Check out the "Import" menu.  Note that this feature was the original
	inspiration for this program, because the other programs available are too simplistic
	to successfully import a large gallery.</p>
	
	<h2>The problem with importing a gallery</h2>
	<p>The hard part about importing a large image gallery from Menalto Gallery
	is that Menalto Gallery allows unlimited nesting of albums within albums, and
	also allows images and sub-albums within the same album.  SmugMug, on the other
	hand, has a fairly rigid structure that you are forced to use, that isn't as
	flexible.  Specifically, they have three concepts: Category (and Subcategory), 
	Album, and Image.  Images can only be in Albums, which can only be in Categories,
	and you must always have at least one category for all your albums.
	So there is no way to include one Album in another, or to include Images alongside
	subalbums, or to nest images more than three levels deep in hierarchy.</p>
	<p>For example, the simplest possible structure for a single image is:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Category</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Album</li>
			<ul><li>Image</li></ul>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<p>And the most complex possible structure is:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Category</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Subcategory</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Album</li>
				<ul><li>Image</li></ul>
			</ul>
			<li>Album</li>
			<ul><li>Image</li></ul>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<p>This causes a significant problem if you are trying to import a gallery with
	more than three levels (Category->Subcategory->Album) of images, or that mixes
	images and albums together within a single album.</p>
	
	<h2>How Smuganizer can help</h2>
	<p>The whole idea behind Smuganizer is that it helps you sort out these issues
	<em>before</em> you actually import all your images into SmugMug.  Specifically,
	when you use the Import feature, Smuganizer will warn you about any unexpected
	consequences, and give you the chance to rearrange the final destination of all 
	your images, before starting the import.  Just try it and see!</p>
